# SankalpiQ â€“ Building Tomorrow, Today

## Overview

**SankalpiQ** is a modular, AI-powered multi-agent system designed to assist NGOs in streamlining their outreach, onboarding, data collection, and volunteer engagement operations. The system leverages language models, automation frameworks, and communication APIs to create a fully autonomous support infrastructure that reduces manual workload and improves impact efficiency.

---

## Problem Statement

Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) often operate with limited resources and heavy manual workloads, particularly in areas like:

- Volunteer onboarding
- Blood donation campaigns
- Event response coordination
- Public outreach
- Certification and communication

Manual operations result in delays, data inconsistencies, and increased operational costs. There is a critical need for an automated, intelligent system to streamline these workflows across languages and regions.

---

## Solution

**SankalpiQ** orchestrates multiple AI agents to automate:

- Voice-based onboarding and information capture
- Real-time WhatsApp and email-based communication
- Dynamic certificate generation
- Multilingual conversational assistance
- Emergency detection and campaign triggering via news scraping

This system helps NGOs better manage their volunteer base, improve donor relationships, and respond faster to public needs.

## Use Case Example: Blood Donation Drive

**Scenario:** A college student, Aakash, sees an NGO helpline poster and decides to register as a donor.

**Flow:**

1. Aakash calls the NGO number.
2. The **Info Calling Agent** collects his details (name, blood group, email).
3. Aakash asks questions about the NGO and next camp date, answered by the **LLM Agent**.
4. A confirmation message is sent via the **WhatsApp Agent**.
5. The **Email Agent** sends onboarding details and donation guidance.
6. A **Certificate Agent** automatically sends a digital volunteer certificate.
7. In the future, if a news article reports a local emergency, the **Scraper Agent** triggers a broadcast to all nearby donors.
